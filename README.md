#     FOOD-REDISTRIBUTION-SYSTEM
The Food Redistribution System is a project that
focuses on solving global issues of food wastage
and hunger by creating an efficient redistribution
platform. This system connects donors
(restaurants, households), NGOs, and volunteers
for the seamless collection and delivery of surplus
food.
The system uses data structures like graphs,
priority queues, and hash tables to optimize food
delivery routes and manage real-time operations
effectively. The implementation is in C
programming, ensuring modularity, efficiency, and
adaptability
